# Project Goals 

* Find the correlation between educational environment and crime rates in the City of Chicago 

**Hypothesis**: Unequal educational environments lead to higher crime rates (What are the limitations and causes?)

## Project Driving Questions 
* Does providing a better educational environment decrease the crime rates? 

## Education Environment 

* Schools
    * Ratings (How rating are determined)
    * Economic divide (environment of school)
        * Title I schools and relationship with crime rates
    * Racial composition 
    * Public vs. Private schools 
    * School Funding 
    * Graduation rates
* Libraries 
* Computer labs 
* Wifi Access

## Crime 

* Limitation: some coordinates are given others aren't; only use those with coordinates
* Keywords: crime class

### Separating different types of crime (felonies, misdemeanor, repeated)

# Visualization 

* Map
    * Crime map overlayed with ethnic background map 
    * Crime map overlayed with school map (Emma)
        * Bubble size show number of low income students
        * Color of the bubble become the rating of the school
    * Crime map overlayed with ward map (district) (Tin)
        * Frequency of crime within the ward (ward number) (chloropleth of crime in each ward)
* Scatter plots
* Histograms
* Bell curve
