# Project Goals 

* Find the correlation between educational environment and crime rates in the City of Chicago 

**Hypothesis**: Unequal educational environments lead to higher crime rates (What are the limitations and causes?)

## Project Driving Questions 
* Does providing a better educational environment decrease the crime rates? 

## Education Environment 

* Schools
    * Ratings (How rating are determined)
    * Economic divide (environment of school)
        * Title I schools and relationship with crime rates
    * Racial composition 
    * Public vs. Private schools 
    * School Funding 
    * Graduation rates
* Libraries 
* Computer labs 
* Wifi Access

## Crime 

* Limitation: some coordinates are given others aren't; only use those with coordinates
* Keywords: crime class

### Separating different types of crime (felonies, misdemeanor, repeated)

# Visualization 

* Map
    * Crime map overlayed with ethnic background map 
    * Crime map overlayed with ward map (district) 
        * Frequency of crime within the ward (ward number) (chloropleth of crime in each ward)
    * Interact map over zipcode bounded map 
        * Select data to be points of crime 
* Scatter plots
    * Affordable housing correlation with income (more affordable housing = lower income)
    * Crime map overlayed with school map 
        * Bubble size show number of low income students
        * Color of the bubble become the rating of the school
* Histograms
* Bell curve 

# Tin To-Do 
    * Interact map over zipcode bounded map 
        * Select data to be crime
    [x] Outline the boundary of community map 
        * Combine this with the Per Capita Income map (https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Per-Capita-Income/r6ad-wvtk)
            * Check out columns of people without high school diploma 
    [x] Crime and income map 
    [] Residential based map to see if crime is related to tourists area or to actual education 
        * What we want to see: more residential crime in places where education is less 
        * Define residential area not including: 
            

# Emma To-Do
    * Crime map overlayed with school map 
        * Bubble size show number of low income students
        * Color of the bubble become the rating of the school
    * At least two educaitonal related graphs 
        * Library connection and crime 
        * Property taxes
